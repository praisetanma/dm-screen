# Actions in Combat

## Attack
You make a melee or ranged weapon attack.

## Cast a Spell
You cast a cantrip or a spell of 1st level or higher. See the spell's casting time.

## Dash
You gain extra movement equal to your speed (plus any modifiers) for the current turn.

## Disengage
Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

## Dodge
Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make **Dexterity** saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.

## Help
You help one creature with a task, giving that creature advantage on the next ability check it makes for that task. Or you distract one creature within 5 feet of you, and the next attack roll that an ally of yours makes against that creature has advantage.
Whichever option you choose, the advantage goes away once used or when your next turn starts.

## Hide
You make a [Stealth](#skill-and-associated-abilities) check in an attempt to become hidden—unseen and unheard.

## Ready
You wait for a particular circumstance before you act, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. You must decide in advance (a) what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction and (b) the action you will take in response to this trigger.  
If you ready a spell, it must have a casting time of 1 action, and you must concentrate on it until you release it.

## Search
You make a [Perception](#skill-and-associated-abilities) check or an [Investigation](#skill-and-associated-abilities) check to find something.

## Use a Magic Item
You use a magic item that requires your action for its use.

## Use an Object
You use an object, other than a magiic item, that requires your action for its use.

## Use a Special Ability
You use a class feature or other special ability that requires your action for its use.

# Misc

## Long Jump
Move 10+ feet, and jump a number of feet up to your **Strength** score. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.

## High Jump
Move 10+ feet, and jump a number of feet equal to 3 + your **Strength** modifier. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance.

## Suffocating
You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your **Constitution** modifier (min 30s).  
If you run out of breath or you're choking, you can survive for a number of rounds equal to your **Constitution** modifier (min 1 round). At the start of your next turn, you drop to 0 hit points and are dying, and you can't regain hit points or be stabilized until you can breathe again.

## Concentration
If a spell must be maintained with concentration, its description specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors can break your concentration:  
* You cast another spell that requires concentration.
* You take damage. Succeed on a **Constitution** saving throw to maintain your concentration, with a DC equal 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher.
* You're incapacitated or killed.
* You're overwhelmed by an enormous distraction, such as a wave crashing into you. Succeed on a DC 10 **Constitution** saving throw to maintain your concentration.

# Things You Can Do on Your Turn
